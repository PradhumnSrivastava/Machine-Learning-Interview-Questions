7. Precision vs recall — when would you prioritize each?
Ans- 99% accuracy can be a terrible metric when the dataset is highly imbalanced. For example, suppose we have 10,000 transactions, out of which 9,900 are legitimate and only 100 are fraudulent. If a model simply predicts every transaction as legitimate, it will achieve 99% accuracy, even though it detects zero fraudulent transactions. Therefore, accuracy can give a misleading impression of model performance when one class dominates the dataset. In such cases, we should also consider metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, PR-AUC, or cost-based metrics, depending on the business objective.
